## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me  
I'm a **Backend Developer** with nearly 3 years of experience building fast, secure, and scalable systems using JavaScript technologies. I specialize in Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL, and I enjoy building APIs and services that power modern web applications.

I‚Äôm also experienced with **Docker** and setting up **CI/CD pipelines** to make deployments smooth and efficient. My development style focuses on writing clean, maintainable code and building systems that are easy to scale and debug.

Recently, I've been **diving into Web3 development**, learning how blockchain can reshape the backend and how to build services that interact with smart contracts and decentralized systems.

When I‚Äôm not coding, you‚Äôll probably find me:
- Playing a round of **chess**
- Watching a **movie**
- Learning something new to level up my skills
